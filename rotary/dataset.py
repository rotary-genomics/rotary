    This method generates a Dataset object from the FASTQ files located in the specified directory. The method first
    generates a series of SequencingFile objects representing the FASTQ files using the get_fastq_files_in_directory
    method.

    Then, it organizes the files into groups based on their identifiers using a dictionary called samples_files.
    Each key in the dictionary represents a unique identifier, and the corresponding value is a list of files
    associated with that identifier.

    Next, the method iterates through the samples_files dictionary to process each group of sequencing files.
    It ensures that each group has exactly three files. If not, it raises a ValueError indicating that a sample should
    have three sequencing files.

    For each group of sequencing files, the method identifies the long_file (a file with no R value), the
    left_short_file (typically an R1 file), and the right_short_file (typically an R2 file). It creates a
    Sample object with these files and adds it to the samples list.

    Finally, the method creates a Dataset object using the samples list and returns it.
